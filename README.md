# Sobol library for Futhark

This library is a convenient and modular library for efficiently
generating large quantities of quasi-random numbers (in multiple
dimensions) in a parallel and purely functional setting.  Sobol
numbers are particularly useful for Monte Carlo simulations, which are
a core application of massive parallelism.

Sobol sequences are quasi-random low-discrepancy sequences frequently
used in Monte-Carlo algorithms and they generalize nicely to multiple
dimensions.  Sobol sequences are superior to traditional pseudo-random
numbers for numeric integration (by Monte-Carlo simulation).  Sobol
sequences simply span the space much better than their pseudo-random
counterparts. In fact, it has been shown that while the value of a
multi-dimensional integral for a continuous and differentiable
function can be approximated with a convergence rate of _1/n_ using
pseudo-random numbers, using Sobol sequences, the convergence rate is
_1/sqrt(n)_.

For a discussion of the implementation, please consult [1].
